# Calculator-App
# Simple Python Calculator

## Description
This is a simple command-line calculator written in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program runs in a loop, enabling continuous calculations until the user chooses to exit.

## Features
- Supports **Addition**, **Subtraction**, **Multiplication**, and **Division**.
- Uses a **while loop** for continuous operation.
- Allows users to **exit** the program by entering 'q' or 'Q'.
- Includes a **division by zero error check**.

## How to Use
1. Run the Python script.
2. Select an operation by entering the corresponding number:
   - `1` for Addition
   - `2` for Subtraction
   - `3` for Multiplication
   - `4` for Division
3. Enter two numbers when prompted.
4. View the result.
5. Repeat or exit by entering 'q' or 'Q'.

## Example Run
```
1 Addition
2 Subtraction
3 Multiplication
4 Division
Enter q or Q to Exit

Enter your choice : 1
Enter Number 1 : 5
Enter Number 2 : 3
5.0 + 3.0 = 8.0
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Error Handling
- If the user enters an invalid choice, an error message is displayed.
- If the user attempts to divide by zero, an appropriate warning is shown.

## Future Improvements
- Add more operations such as exponentiation and modulus.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Improve input validation to handle non-numeric inputs.
